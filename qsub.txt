       qsub - submit pbs job

SYNOPSIS
       qsub  [-a date_time] [-A account_string] [-c interval] [-C
       directive_prefix] [-e path] [-h] [-I] [-j join] [-k  keep]
       [-l  resource_list]  [-m  mail_options] [-M user_list] [-N
       name] [-o path] [-p priority] [-q destination] [-r c]  [-S
       path_list]  [-u  user_list]  [-v  variable_list]  [-V] [-W
       additional_attributes] [-z] [script]

DESCRIPTION
       To create a job is to submit an  executable  script  to  a
       batch server.  The batch server will be the default server
       unless the -q option  is  specified.   See  discussion  of
       PBS_DEFAULT under Environment Variables below.  Typically,
       the script is a shell script which will be executed  by  a
       command shell such as sh or csh.

       Options  on  the  qsub  command allow the specification of
       attributes which affect the behavior of the job.

       The qsub command will pass certain  environment  variables
       in  the  Variable_List  attribute of the job.  These vari-
       ables will be available to the job.   The  value  for  the
       following  variables will be taken from the environment of
       the qsub command: HOME, LANG, LOGNAME, PATH, MAIL,  SHELL,
       and TZ.  These values will be assigned to a new name which
       is the current name prefixed  with  the  string  "PBS_O_".
       For  example,  the  job will have access to an environment
       variable named PBS_O_HOME which  have  the  value  of  the
       variable HOME in the qsub command environment.

       In  addition to the above, the following environment vari-
       ables will be available to the batch job.

       PBS_O_HOST
              the name of the host upon which the qsub command is
              running.

       PBS_O_QUEUE
              the name of the original queue to which the job was
              submitted.

       PBS_O_WORKDIR
              the absolute path of the current working  directory
              of the qsub command.

       PBS_ENVIRONMENT
              set  to  PBS_BATCH  to  indicate the job is a batch
              job, or to PBS_INTERACTIVE to indicate the job is a
              PBS interactive job, see -I option.

       PBS_JOBID
              the job identifier assigned to the job by the batch
              system.

       PBS_JOBNAME
              the job name supplied by the user.

       PBS_NODEFILE
              the name of the file  contain  the  list  of  nodes
              assigned  to the job (for parallel and cluster sys-
              tems).

       PBS_QUEUE
              the name of the queue from which the  job  is  exe-
              cuted.

OPTIONS
       -a date_time
               Declares  the time after which the job is eligible
               for execution.

               The   date_time   argument   is   in   the   form:
               [[[[CC]YY]MM]DD]hhmm[.SS]

               Where  CC is the first two digits of the year (the
               century), YY is the second two digits of the year,
               MM  is the two digits for the month, DD is the day
               of the month, hh is the hour, mm  is  the  minute,
               and the optional SS is the seconds.

               If  the  month,  MM,  is  not  specified,  it will
               default to the current month if the specified  day
               DD,  is  in the future.  Otherwise, the month will
               be set to next month.  Likewise, if the  day,  DD,
               is  not specified, it will default to today if the
               time hhmm is in the future.   Otherwise,  the  day
               will  be  set  to  tomorrow.   For example, if you
               sumit a job at 11:15am with a time of -a 1110, the
               job will be eligable to run at 11:10am tomorrow.

       -A account_string
               Defines  the  account  string  associated with the
               job.  The account_string is an undefined string of
               characters  and is interpreted by the server which
               executes the job.  See section 2.7.1  of  the  PBS
               ERS.

       -c interval
               Defines  the  interval  at  which  the job will be
               checkpointed.  If the job  executes  upon  a  host
               which  does  not  support  checkpoint, this option
               will be ignored.

               The interval argument is specified as:

               n  No checkpointing is to be performed.

               s  Checkpointing is to be performed only when  the
                  server executing the job is shutdown.

               c  Checkpointing is to be performed at the default
                  minimum time for the server executing the  job.

               c=minutes
                  Checkpointing is to be performed at an interval
                  of minutes, which is the integer number of min-
                  utes  of  CPU time used by the job.  This value
                  must be greater than zero.

       -C directive_prefix
               Defines the prefix that declares  a  directive  to
               the  qsub command within the script file.  See the
               paragraph on script  directives  in  the  Extended
               Description section.

               If  the  -C  option  is  presented  with  a direc-
               tive_prefix argument that is the null string, qsub
               will not scan the script file for directives.

       -e path Defines the path to be used for the standard error
               stream of the batch job.  The path argument is  of
               the form:
                   [hostname:]path_name
               where  hostname is the name of a host to which the
               file will be returned and path_name  is  the  path
               name  on  that  host  in  the syntax recognized by
               POSIX.  The argument will be interpreted  as  fol-
               lows:

               path_name
                      Where  path_name  is  not  an absolute path
                      name, then the qsub command will expand the
                      path  name  relative to the current working
                      directory of the command.  The command will
                      supply  the  name of the host upon which it
                      is executing for the hostname component.

               hostname:path_name
                      Where path_name is  not  an  absolute  path
                      name, then the qsub command will not expand
                      the path name relative to the current work-
                      ing  directory of the command.  On delivery
                      of the standard error, the path  name  will
                      be  expanded  relative  to  the user's home
                      directory on the hostname system.

               path_name
                      Where path_name specifies an absolute  path
                      name, then the qsub will supply the name of
                      the host on which it is executing  for  the
                      hostname.

               hostname:path_name
                      Where  path_name specifies an absolute path
                      name, the path will be used as specified.

               If the -e option is  not  specified,  the  default
               file  name  for  the standard error stream will be
               used.  The default name has the following form:
                   job_name.esequence_number
               where job_name is the name  of  the  job,  see  -N
               option,  and  sequence_number  is  the  job number
               assigned when the job is submitted.

       -h      Specifies that a user hold be applied to  the  job
               at submission time.

       -I      Declares  that  the  job  is  to  be run "interac-
               tively".  The job will be queued and scheduled  as
               any PBS batch job, but when executed, the standard
               input, output, and error streams of  the  job  are
               connected  through qsub to the terminal session in
               which qsub is running.  See the "Extended Descrip-
               tion" paragraph for addition information of inter-
               active jobs.

       -j join Declares if the standard error stream of  the  job
               will  be merged with the standard output stream of
               the job.

               An option argument value of oe  directs  that  the
               two  streams  will be merged, intermixed, as stan-
               dard output.   An  option  argument  value  of  eo
               directs  that  the  two  streams  will  be merged,
               intermixed, as standard error.

               If the join argument is n or  the  option  is  not
               specified,  the  two  streams will be two separate
               files.

       -k keep Defines which (if either) of  standard  output  or
               standard  error  will be retained on the execution
               host.  If set for a stream, this option  overrides
               the  path  name for that stream.  If not set, nei-
               ther stream is retained on the execution host.

               The argument is either the single  letter  "e"  or
               "o", or the letters "e" and "o" combined in either
               order.  Or the argument is the letter n.

               e  The standard error stream is to retained on the
                  execution  host.  The  stream will be placed in
                  the home directory of the user under whose user
                  id the job executed.  The file name will be the
                  default file name given by:  job_name.esequence
                  where  job_name  is  the name specified for the
                  job, and sequence is the sequence number compo-
                  nent of the job identifier.

               o  The  standard  output  stream is to retained on
                  the execution host.  The  stream will be placed
                  in  the  home directory of the user under whose
                  user id the job executed.  The file  name  will
                  be    the   default   file   name   given   by:
                  job_name.osequence where job_name is  the  name
                  specified  for  the  job,  and  sequence is the
                  sequence number component of  the  job  identi-
                  fier.

               eo Both  the  standard  output  and standard error
                  streams will be retained.

               oe Both the standard  output  and  standard  error
                  streams will be retained.

               n  Neither stream is retained.

       -l resource_list
               Defines the resources that are required by the job
               and establishes a limit to the amount of  resource
               that  can be consumed.  If not set for a generally
               available resource, such as CPU time, the limit is
               infinite.   The  resource_list  argument is of the
               form:
                   resource_name[=[value]][,resource_name[=[value]],...]

       -m mail_options
               Defines the set of conditions under which the exe-
               cution server will send a mail message  about  the
               job.   The mail_options argument is a string which
               consists of either the single  character  "n",  or
               one or more of the characters "a", "b", and "e".

               If the character "n" is specified, no mail will be
               sent.

               For the letters "a", "b", and "e":

               a  mail is sent when the job  is  aborted  by  the
                  batch system.

               b  mail is sent when the job begins execution.

               e  mail is sent when the job terminates.

               If  the  -m  option is not specified, mail will be
               sent if the job is aborted.

       -M user_list
               Declares the list of users to whom mail is sent by
               the  execution server when it sends mail about the
               job.

               The user_list argument is of the form:
                   user[@host][,user[@host],...]
               If unset, the list defaults to the submitting user
               at the qsub host, i.e. the job owner.

       -N name Declares  a  name for the job.  The name specified
               may be  up  to  and  including  15  characters  in
               length.   It  must consist of printable, non white
               space characters with the first  character  alpha-
               betic.

               If  the  -N  option is not specified, the job name
               will be the base name of the job script file spec-
               ified on the command line.  If no script file name
               was specified and the script  was  read  from  the
               standard  input,  then the job name will be set to
               STDIN.

       -o path Defines the path to be used for the standard  out-
               put stream of the batch job.  The path argument is
               of the form:
                   [hostname:]path_name
               where hostname is the name of a host to which  the
               file  will  be  returned and path_name is the path
               name on that host  in  the  syntax  recognized  by
               POSIX.   The  argument will be interpreted as fol-
               lows:

               path_name
                      Where path_name is  not  an  absolute  path
                      name, then the qsub command will expand the
                      path name relative to the  current  working
                      directory of the command.  The command will
                      supply the name of the host upon  which  it
                      is executing for the hostname component.

               hostname:path_name
                      Where  path_name  is  not  an absolute path
                      name, then the qsub command will not expand
                      the path name relative to the current work-
                      ing directory of the command.  On  delivery
                      of  the standard output, the path name will
                      be expanded relative  to  the  user's  home
                      directory on the hostname system.

               path_name
                      Where  path_name specifies an absolute path
                      name, then the qsub will supply the name of
                      the  host  on which it is executing for the
                      hostname.

               hostname:path_name
                      Where path_name specifies an absolute  path
                      name, the path will be used as specified.

               If  the  -o  option  is not specified, the default
               file name for the standard output stream  will  be
               used.  The default name has the following form:
                   job_name.osequence_number
               where  job_name  is  the  name  of the job, see -N
               option, and  sequence_number  is  the  job  number
               assigned when the job is submitted.

       -p priority
               Defines  the  priority  of  the job.  The priority
               argument must be a integer between -1024 and +1023
               inclusive.   The  default  is no priority which is
               equivalent to a priority of zero.

       -q destination
               Defines the destination of the job.  The  destina-
               tion  names  a  queue,  a  server, or a queue at a
               server.

               The qsub command will submit  the  script  to  the
               server  defined  by  the destination argument.  If
               the destination is a routing queue, the job may be
               routed by the server to a new destination.

               If  the  -q option is not specified, the qsub com-
               mand will submit the script to the default server.
               See  PBS_DEFAULT  under  the Environment Variables
               section on this man page and the PBS  ERS  section
               2.7.4, "Default Server".

               If the -q option is specified, it is in one of the
               following three forms:
                   queue
                   @server
                   queue@server

               If the destination argument names a queue and does
               not  name  a  server, the job will be submitted to
               the named queue at the default server.

               If the destination argument  names  a  server  and
               does  not  name a queue, the job will be submitted
               to the default queue at the named server.

               If the destination argument names both a queue and
               a  server,  the job will be submitted to the named
               queue at the named server.

       -r y|n  Declares whether the job is  rerunable.   See  the
               qrerun  command.   The option argument is a single
               character, either y or n.

               If the argument is "y", the job is rerunable.   If
               the  argument  is  "n",  the job is not rerunable.
               The default value is 'y', rerunable.

       -S path_list
               Declares the shell that interprets the job script.

               The option argument path_list is in the form:
                   path[@host][,path[@host],...]
               Only one path may be specified for any host named.
               Only one path may be specified without the  corre-
               sponding host name.  The path selected will be the
               one with the host name that matched  the  name  of
               the execution host.  If no matching host is found,
               then the path specified without  a  host  will  be
               selected, if present.

               If  the  -S  option  is  not specified, the option
               argument is the null string, or no entry from  the
               path_list  is selected, the execution will use the
               user's login shell on the execution host.

       -u user_list
               Defines the user name under which the  job  is  to
               run on the execution system.

               The user_list argument is of the form:
                   user[@host][,user[@host],...]
               Only  one  user  name  may  be given per specified
               host.  Only one of the user specifications may  be
               supplied without the corresponding host specifica-
               tion.  That user name will used for  execution  on
               any  host  not  named  in  the  argument list.  If
               unset, the user list defaults to the user  who  is
               running qsub.

       -v variable_list
               Expands the list of environment variables that are
               exported to the job.

               In addition to  the  variables  described  in  the
               "Description"  section  above, variable_list names
               environment variables from the qsub command  envi-
               ronment  which  are made available to the job when
               it executes.  The variable_list is a  comma  sepa-
               rated  list  of  strings  of  the form variable or
               variable=value.  These variables and their  values
               are passed to the job.

       -V      Declares  that  all  environment  variables in the
               qsub command's environment are to be  exported  to
               the batch job.

       -W additional_attributes
               The  -W  option  allows  for  the specification of
               additional job attributes.  The general syntax  of
               the -W is in the form:
                   -W attr_name=attr_value[,attr_name=attr_value...]
               Note if white space  occurs  anywhere  within  the
               option  argument  string  or  the equal sign, "=",
               occurs within an attribute_value string, then  the
               string must be enclosed with either single or dou-
               ble quote marks.

               PBS currently supports  the  following  attributes
               within the -W option.

               depend=dependency_list
               Defines  the  dependency  between  this  and other
               jobs.  The dependency_list is in the form:
               type[:argument[:argument...][,type:argument...].
               The argument is either a numeric count  or  a  PBS
               job  id  according  to  type  .   If argument is a
               count, it must be greater than 0.  If it is a  job
               id   and   not   fully   specified   in  the  form
               seq_number.server.name,  it   will   be   expanded
               according  to the default server rules which apply
               to job IDs on most commands.  If argument is  null
               (the  preceeding colon need not be specified), the
               dependency of the cooresponding  type  is  cleared
               (unset).

                   synccount:count
                       This  job is the first in a set of jobs to
                       be executed at the same  time.   Count  is
                       the  number of additional jobs in the set.

                   syncwith:jobid
                       This job is an additional member of a  set
                       of  jobs  to be executed at the same time.
                       In  the  above  and  following  dependency
                       types,  jobid is the job identifier of the
                       first job in the set.

                   after:jobid[:jobid...]
                       This job may be scheduled for execution at
                       any  point  after  jobs jobid have started
                       execution.

                   afterok:jobid[:jobid...]
                       This job may be  scheduled  for  execution

                       This job may be  scheduled  for  execution
                       after  jobs jobid have terminated, with or
                       without errors.

                   on:count
                       This job may be  scheduled  for  execution
                       after  count  dependencies  on  other jobs
                       have been satisfied.  This form is used in
                       conjunction  with one of the before forms,
                       see below.

                   before:jobid[:jobid...]
                       When this job has  begun  execution,  then
                       jobs jobid... may begin.

                   beforeok:jobid[:jobid...]
                       If  this  job terminates execution without
                       errors, then jobs jobid... may begin.  See

                       jobid... may begin.

                       If any of the before forms are  used,  the
                       jobs  referenced  by  jobid must have been
                       submitted with a dependency type of on.

                       If any of the before forms are  used,  the
                       jobs  referenced  by  jobid  must have the
                       same owner as  the  job  being  submitted.
                       Otherwise, the dependency is ignored.

                   Error  processing  of the existence, state, or
                   condition of the job on which the  newly  sub-
                   mitted  job  is  a  deferred service, i.e. the
                   check is performed after the  job  is  queued.
                   If  an  error is detected, the new job will be
                   deleted by the server.  Mail will be  sent  to
                   the job submitter stating the error.

                   Dependency examples:
                   qsub     -W    depend=afterok:123.big.iron.com
                   /tmp/script
                   qsub                                        -W
                   depend=before:234.hunk1.com:235.hunk1.com
                   /tmp/script

               group_list=g_list
               Defines the group name under which the job  is  to
               run  on the execution system.  The g_list argument
               is of the form:
               group[@host][,group[@host],...]
               Only one group name may  be  given  per  specified
               host.  Only one of the group specifications may be
               supplied without the corresponding host specifica-
               tion.   That group name will used for execution on
               any host not named in the argument list.   If  not
               set,  the group_list defaults to the primary group
               of the user under which the job will be run.

               interactive=true
               If the interactive attribute is specified, the job
               is  an interactive job.  The -I option is a alter-
               native method of specifying this attribute.

               stagein=file_list
               stageout=file_list
               Specifies  which  files  are  staged  (copied)  in
               before  job start or staged out after the job com-
               pletes execution.  On completion of the  job,  all
               staged-in  and  staged-out  files are removed from
               the execution system.  The  file_list  is  in  the
               form
               local_file@hostname:remote_file[,...]
               regardless of the direction of the copy.  The name
               local_file is the name of the file on  the  system
               where  the  job  executed.   It may be an absolute
               path or relative to  the  home  directory  of  the
               user.   The  name  remote_file  is the destination
               name on the host specified by hostname.  The  name
               may  be  absolute  or  relative to the user's home
               directory on the destination  host.   The  use  of
               wildcards  in  the  file  name is not recommended.
               The file names map to a remote copy program  (rcp)
               call on the execution system in the follow manner:
               For stagein:   rcp hostname:remote_file local_file
               For stageout:  rcp local_file hostname:remote_file

       -z      Directs that the qsub command is not to write  the
               job  identifier  assigned  to  the job to the com-
               mand's standard output.

OPERANDS
       The qsub command accepts a script operand that is the path
       to  the  script  of  the job.  If the path is relative, it
       will be expanded relative to the working directory of  the
       qsub command.

       If  the  script  operand is not provided or the operand is
       the single character  "-",  the  qsub  command  reads  the
       script from standard input.  When the script is being read
       from Standard Input, qsub will copy the file to  a  tempo-
       rary  file.   This temporary file is passed to the library
       interface  routine  pbs_submit.   The  temporary  file  is
       removed  by  qsub  after  pbs_submit  returns  or upon the
       receipt of a signal which would cause qsub to terminate.

STANDARD INPUT
       The qsub command reads the script for the job  from  stan-
       dard input if the script operand is missing or is the sin-
       gle character "-".

INPUT FILES
       The script file is read by the qsub  command.   Qsub  acts
       upon any directives found in the script.

       When the job is created, a copy of the script file is made
       and that copy cannot be modified.

STANDARD OUTPUT
       Unless the -z option is set, the job  identifier  assigned
       to  the  job will be written to standard output if the job
       is successfully created.

STANDARD ERROR
       The qsub command will write a diagnostic message to  stan-
       dard error for each error occurrence.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The  values  of  some  or all of the variables in the qsub
       command's environment are exported with the job,  see  the
       -v and -V options.

       The  environment  variable PBS_DEFAULT defines the name of
       the default server.   Typically,  it  corresponds  to  the
       system  name  of  the host on which the server is running.
       If PBS_DEFAULT is not set, the default is  defined  by  an
       administrator established file.

       The environment variable PBS_DPREFIX determines the prefix
       string which identifies directives in the script.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       Script Processing:

       A job script may consist of PBS directives,  comments  and
       executable  statements.  A PBS directive provides a way of
       specifying job attributes in addition to the command  line
       options.  For example:
              :
              #PBS -N Job_name
              #PBS -l walltime=10:30,mem=320kb
              #PBS -m be
              #
              step1 arg1 arg2
              step2 arg3 arg4

       The  qsub  command  scans the lines of the script file for
       directives.  An initial line in  the  script  that  begins
       with  the  characters  "#!"  or  the character ":" will be
       ignored and scanning will start with the next line.  Scan-
       ning  will  continue until the first executable line, that
       is a line that is not blank, not a directive line,  nor  a
       line  whose  first  non  white space character is "#".  If
       directives  occur  on  subsequent  lines,  they  will   be
       ignored.

       A line in the script file will be processed as a directive
       to qsub if and only if the string of  characters  starting
       with  the  first non white space character on the line and
       of the same length as the  directive  prefix  matches  the
       directive prefix.

       The  remainder  of  the  directive  line  consists  of the
       options to qsub in the same syntax as they appear  on  the
       command line.  The option character is to be preceded with
       the "-" character.

       If an option is present in both a  directive  and  on  the
       command  line,  that option and its argument, if any, will
       be ignored in  the  directive.   The  command  line  takes
       precedence.

       If an option is present in a directive and not on the com-
       mand line, that option and its argument, if any,  will  be
       processed as if it had occurred on the command line.

       The directive prefix string will be determined in order of
       preference from:

           The value of the -C option argument if the  option  is
           specified on the command line.

           The  value  of the environment variable PBS_DPREFIX if
           it is defined.

           The four character string #PBS.

       If the -C option is found in a  directive  in  the  script
       file, it will be ignored.

       User Authorization:

       When  the  user submits a job from a system other than the
       one on which the PBS Server is  running,  the  name  under
       which  the  job is to be executed is selected according to
       the rules listed under the -u option.  The user submitting
       the job must be authorized to run the job under the execu-
       tion user name.  This authorization is provided if

              (1)  The host on which qsub is run  is  trusted  by
                   the execution host (see /etc/hosts.equiv),

              (2)  The  execution user has an .rhosts file naming
                   the submitting user on the submitting host.

       C-Shell .logout File:

       The following warning applies for users  of  the  c-shell,
       csh.   If  the job is executed under the csh and a .logout
       file exists in the home directory in which  the  job  exe-
       cutes,  the  exit status of the job is that of the .logout
       script, not the job script.  This may impact any inter-job
       dependencies.   To  preserve  the  job exit status, either
       remove the .logout file or place the following line as the
       first line in the .logout file
          set EXITVAL = $status
       and  the  following  line  as  the last executable line in
       .logout
          exit $EXITVAL

       Interactive Jobs:

       If the -I option is specified on the command line or in  a
       script  directive,  or  if the "interactive" job attribute
       declared true via  the  -W  option,  -W  interactive=true,
       either  on  the command line or in a script directive, the
       job is an interactive job.  The script will  be  processed
       for  directives,  but  will  not be included with the job.
       When the job begins execution, all input  to  the  job  is
       from the terminal session in which qsub is running.

       When  an  interactive  job  is submitted, the qsub command
       will not terminate when the job is submitted.   Qsub  will
       remain  running  until  the job terminates, is aborted, or
       the user interrupts qsub with  an  SIGINT  (the  control-C
       key).   If qsub is interrupted prior to job start, it will
       query if the user wishes to exit.  If  the  user  response
       "yes", qsub exits and the job is aborted.

       One  the  interactive  job has started execution, input to
       and output from the job pass through qsub.  Keyboard  gen-
       erated  interrupts  are  passed to the job.  Lines entered
       that begin with the tilde ('~') character and contain spe-
       cial sequences are escaped by qsub.  The recognized escape
       sequences are:

              ~.     Qsub terminates execution.  The batch job is
                     also terminated.

              ~susp  Suspend  the  qsub  program if running under
                     the C shell.  "susp" is the suspend  charac-

       greater than zero.
